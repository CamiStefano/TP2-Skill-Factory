## **ðŸ’» Skill Factory - Checkpoint 2.** - **React JS.**

---

The assignment for this project (**C2**) was to migrate [our first project](https://github.com/avilalte/TP1-Skill-Factory) (**C1**) to a React SPA.

This is a brief description of **C1**:

> _The goal was to create a site with 3 pages which would contain in no specific order: a contact form, a users table, and a set of cards displaying information about Rick and Morty characters._
>
> _For the last two pages the data was fetched from different APIs using **Axios**. Styles were applied using vanilla **CSS**._

---

The following dependencies were used for **C2**:

- Axios.
- React.
- React DOM.
- React Router DOM.
- React Hook Form.
